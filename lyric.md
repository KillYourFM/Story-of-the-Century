Wake up to spend another day in the mist
Breathing the fog that devours memories    
I’d rather sleep because in dreams you still exist
We were perfect, the story of the century

I sat amazed watching our fairly tale unfold 
I held you tight and even chaos was so peaceful
We kissed so hard but then the credits rolled
Is someone writing the sequel

Bridge:
I only have these words because 
you breathed them straight into my soul
And if they’re beautiful                   
they’re just a reflection of you. 

Chorus: 
Now we’re locked here in limbo,
Listless and longing
I don’t know another tempo
It’s only your language I’m singing
Can you replace your face with the memory
We were perfect, the story of the century
